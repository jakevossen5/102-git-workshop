                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <div style="text-align: justify;">
                            Welcome to your assignment for Week 10 of CSCI 102! Each week, <i>after Studio</i>, you
                            should work on that week's homework
                            assignment (lab). This lab is to be done on your own (not pair programming), and
                            needs to be completed and shown to an instructor/TA during Demo Day (Tuesday) <i>before</i>
                            class ends. (NOTE: how we will "demo" is still being determined.)
                            This work should also be submitted to Canvas <i>before</i>
                            class ends as well (and no later than 11:45pm that day). Unlike CSCI 101,
                            we will place all assignments for a given week
                            on one HTML page. This is your Week 10 CSCI 102 Assignment page.<br> <br>

                            You have TWO problems to do after Studio this week, both of which you will
                            (1) DEMO during your 102 class on Tuesday (TBD) and (2) SUBMIT to Canvas
                            (before the end of class). Details on Part A and Part B are below.
                            <br>
                        </div>

                            <h3>Part A: Pre-Studio Class Work (DUE & POINTS HERE)</h3>

                            <h4>Assignment: Installing GitHub Desktop</h4>

                            <div style="text-align: justify;">
                                <code>git</code> is the name of the tool itself, but there are many applications that
                                add a gui (graphical user interface) on top of <code>git</code>. Because
                                <code>git</code> is very visual, using a front-end will make it much easier for us
                                to understand what is going on. There are many front-ends for <code>git</code> (such
                                as <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/">gitkraken</a>, <a
                                    href="https://git-fork.com/">fork</a>, and <a
                                    href="https://tortoisegit.org/">TortoiseGit</a>). For this tutorial, we are
                                going to be using <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a>.

                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>If you do not have one already, create an account on GitHub by going to <a
                                            href="github.com">github.com</a> and clicking on “Sign up” in the upper
                                        right hand corner. I suggest using your personal email, so you can keep projects
                                        that are not for school here as well.</li>
                                    <li>Install GitHub Desktop by going to <a
                                            href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>.</li>
                                    <li>After opening GitHub Desktop, sign into your GitHub account</li>
                                    <li>You can configure how you would like to appear, but I suggest keeping the
                                        defaults.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </div>



                            <hr style="width: 85%; color: #253E6A; border: 1px solid;">
                            <br>
                            <h3>Part B: During Studio Work (DUE & POINTS HERE)</h3>


                            <div style="text-align: justify;">

                                <h4>
                                    FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY KNOW GIT
                                </h4>
                                If you have a lot of experience using the <code>git</code> command line and don’t want
                                to learn a new client, you can follow along with this lab and submit a
                                <code>git log &gt; gitlog.txt</code> instead of a screenshot. If that means nothing to
                                you, you should probably use GitHub Desktop!

                                <h4>Creating your First Repo</h4>

                                Now that you have the GitHub Desktop application installed, we are going to create
                                our first repository!
                                <blockquote>
                                    Note, currently, this will <strong>just</strong> create a repository local to
                                    your computer. Even though this tool is called “GitHub Desktop” your code is
                                    <strong>not</strong> on GitHub, that will be another step down the line.
                                </blockquote>
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>Open GitHub Desktop from where you downloaded / installed it to</li>
                                    <li>File -&gt; New Repository…</li>
                                    <li>Naming is up to you, but later on we are going to be adding our old 101 / 102
                                        labs, so I suggest something like <code>csci-101-102-labs</code>.</li>
                                    <li>Change the Local Path to something you can easily find - I suggest the Desktop
                                        for this project</li>
                                    <li>Check the box next to ‘Initialize this project with a README’</li>
                                    <li>Select <code>Python</code> under the ‘Git Ignore’ - we will talk more about
                                        <code>git</code> ignore files more next in the next part</li>
                                </ol>
                                In the end, your repository should look like this:
                                <figure>
                                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="new-repo.png" alt="" />
                                </figure>
                                Change the local path if desired, and hit “Create Repository”!

                                <h4>Creating Files in our Repo</h4>

                                You should have a new folder named <code>csci-101-102-labs</code> in wherever you
                                created the repository with a file called <code>READEME.md</code> in it. This is
                                just like any folder on our computer, and we can add any files to it. However, we
                                are typically dealing with code in our <code>git</code> repository, so lets create a
                                simple Python program to add to our <code>git</code> repo.
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>Open IDLE and create a new Python program</li>
                                    <li>Add the contents <code>print("Hello world, but in git!")</code> the file</li>
                                    <li>Save the file into where the repository was created, naming it
                                        <code>hello.py</code></li>
                                    <li>Verify that you have two files (<code>hello.py</code>, <code>README.md</code>)
                                        inside a folder titled <code>csci-101-102-labs</code></li>
                                </ol>
                                As you can see, this folder is just like other folders on your computer, but
                                <code>git</code> is keeping track of some things for you behind the scenes.

                                <h4>Seeing our changes in GitHub Desktop</h4>

                                Navigate back to the GitHub Desktop application, your screen should look something
                                like this:
                                <figure>
                                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="hello-change.png" alt="" />

                                </figure>
                                There are a number of different views we can see here
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The ‘main’ view on the right that shows the difference between your changes and
                                        the last commit</li>
                                    <li>The files you have changed on the left. The checkbox being checked means the
                                        file is <strong>staged</strong> and will be a part of the next commit. Selecting
                                        a file here will bring it into the main view, and you can see the changes made
                                        to that file</li>
                                    <li>The bottom left is where you add a message and optional description to your
                                        commit</li>
                                </ul>

                                <!-- <h6>Committing</h6> -->

                                We can go ahead and ‘commit’ our change. This means that <code>git</code> will
                                remember what the files look like in our repository at this snapshot in time.
                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>Put your commit message in the box that currently says “Create hello.py”. This
                                        message should be something that is useful for future programmers who have to
                                        analyze it. You can put any text here, I would suggest something like “created a
                                        hello world file”.</li>
                                    <li>Then, go ahead and hit the “Commit to master”.</li>
                                </ol>
                                You should now see “no local changes” in your GitHub Desktop.

                                <h4> Making changes </h4>
                                Go back to your <code>hello.py</code> file and add a second line that prints ‘It is
                                not a bug, it is a feature’. Your <code>hello.py</code> should look like this now:

                                <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1">
                                    <pre
                                        class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello world, but in git!&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;It is not a bug, it is a feature&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre>
                                </div>
                                Back on GitHub Desktop, your screen should look like this
                                <figure>
                                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="1st-change.png" alt="" />
                                </figure>
                                Here we can see what is called a <strong>diff</strong> view, and compare the changes
                                we have made since our last commit. Go ahead and give this a descriptive commit

                                <h4>Reverting Changes</h4>
                                Down the line, it turns out that the change you just made is destroying the
                                production database. Luckily, because we are using <code>git</code>, we can easily
                                revert to any version of our software, so we can revert it to a known working state.

                                <ol type="1">
                                    <li>Because we are going to be modifying the <code>hello.py</code> via
                                        <code>git</code>, close <code>hello.py</code> from IDLE</li>
                                    <li>Go to the “History” tab on the left hand side of GitHub Desktop</li>
                                    <li>Right click on the most recent commit, it should be the one that added the
                                        <code>print("it is not a bug, it is a feature")</code></li>
                                    <li>Click on “Revert this Commit”</li>
                                </ol>
                                You should see a new commit added to the history that says “Revert (your commit
                                message here)”. In order to revert a commit, <code>git</code> creates a new commit
                                that is the ‘opposite’ of the commit you want to revert.
                                <figure>
                                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="revert.png" alt="" />
                                </figure>
                                Now, you can open <code>hello.py</code> again in IDLE, and you should see that it is
                                back to just <code>print("Hello world, but in git!")</code>.

                                If you used the <code>git</code> from the command line, you can run
                                <code>git log &gt; gitlog.txt</code> and submit the resulting text file.

                                    Now that we have our git repository local to our computer, the next step is going
                                    to be making it available via GitHub. Because we are using GitHub desktop, this
                                    will be really easy!
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>If you don’t have it open already, open GitHub desktop. If the repository we
                                            created in the previous part is not what is listed in the very top left,
                                            click on it and select the name of the repo you created in the previous
                                            part.</li>
                                        <li>On the top menu bar, click on the option that says “Publish this Repository”
                                        </li>
                                        <li>All of the default settings should be fine, but it is <strong><em>very
                                                    important that your code is private</em></strong>, because we will
                                            be uploading our 101 and 102 labs to here</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <figure>
                                        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="publish-repo.png" alt="" />
                                    </figure>
                                    Go ahead and click on “Publish Repository” now.
                                    We are going to view our code on the GitHub website. This will make it clear what
                                    is on our local repo, and what has been pushed to master. You can do this by
                                    navigating to
                                    <code>https://github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/csci-101-102-labs</code>. Right
                                    now, it should look identical to the code you have in your local repository. If
                                    you try and visit it and you get a “page not found error”, sign into GitHub and
                                    try again. It should look something like this.
                                    <figure>
                                        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="inital-github.png" alt="" />
                                    </figure>

                                    <h4>Adding our Python Code</h4>

                                    So we have a large number of files to work with, we are going to be adding our
                                    old 101 and 102 labs to this local repository.
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>Create two folders, a <code>101</code> and a <code>102</code> folder from
                                            Finder / File explorer</li>
                                        <li><strong>Copy</strong> your 101 labs to the 101 folder, and your 102 labs to
                                            your 102 folder</li>
                                        <li>Open GitHub Desktop</li>
                                        <li>Select all of your <strong>101</strong> labs only on the left hand side
                                            (remember, what is selected is what is staged for commit)</li>
                                        <li>In the commit summary area, write something like ‘added 101 labs’</li>
                                        <li>Verify that your GitHub Desktop looks something similar to mine. I don’t
                                            have all of the 101 and 102 labs, so the number of files / the name of your
                                            files should vary from mine.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <figure>

                                    </figure>
                                    Lets stop a minute and think about what we do before we hit ‘commit to master’.
                                    As we discussed earlier, committing creates a snapshot of what our files look
                                    like at this current time. This means that the content of the files that we have
                                    staged right now are going to be saved by <code>git</code> forever. With that
                                    being said, go ahead and press ‘commit to master’

                                    <h4>Syncing with GitHub</h4>

                                    Sign back into GitHub and go to your <code>csci-101-102-labs</code> repository.
                                    Look at the files are there. Are they what you expected? They should not have
                                    changed since the last time you looked at GitHub, this is because when we commit
                                    we are <strong>only making changes to our local repository</strong>
                                    How do we make our code available on GitHub? This is called pushing. You can push
                                    to GitHub from GitHub Desktop by pressing the “Push origin” on the top bar.
                                    Now, refresh <code>github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/csci-101-102-labs</code>. You
                                    should see something like this.
                                    <figure>
                                        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="github-after-101.png" alt="" />
                                    </figure>
                                    Take a few minutes and think about what this means. Our <code>101</code> folder
                                    is here, but our <code>102</code> folder is not. This is because we only
                                    commited the changes to our <code>101</code> folder.

                                    <h4>Trying it on your own</h4>
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>On your own, add your 102 labs, commit, and push.</li>
                                        <li>Verify that what you see at
                                            <code>github.com/&lt;yourusername&gt;/csci-101-102-labs</code> is the same
                                            as what you see on GitHub Desktop, and you have no uncommitted changes on
                                            the left.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <h4>Using a <code>.gitignore</code></h4>

                                    What should we do about files that are in our repository but we don’t want
                                    <code>git</code> to ever commit them? Sure, we can make sure that we never check
                                    the check box in GitHub Desktop, but that is annoying, and maybe you have a lot
                                    of files / a whole folder you want to ignore.
                                    <blockquote>
                                        Side note: in practice, this is most often used to stop having binary files
                                        in your <code>git</code> repository. Binary files are the name for the
                                        actual machine code instructions for your computer runs when you run a
                                        program. <code>git</code> works because it just tracks the difference
                                        between files, but because binary files are not plain text, <code>git</code>
                                        would have to save the binary exactly as you generated it each time. This
                                        will quickly make our <code>git</code> repositories become very large, and
                                        theoretically the source code should contain everything needed to generate
                                        that binary anyways, so it is not adding any additional information. Because
                                        Python is an <a
                                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language">interpreted</a>
                                        language, it creates no binaries.
                                    </blockquote>
                                    In this scenario, we want to put the 101 course topics in the same folder but we
                                    don’t want it to be part of our <code>git</code> repository (in reality a small
                                    PDF is not a concerning thing to have in a <code>git</code> repository)
                                    <ol type="1">
                                        <li>Download the 101 course topics <a
                                                href="http://cs-courses.mines.edu/csci101/static/101-Topics.pdf">here</a>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Place that PDF in your <code>csci-101-102-labs</code> folder on your
                                            computer</li>
                                        <li>Open GitHub Desktop, and open the repository if it is not open already</li>
                                        <li>You should see the PDF on the left sidebar of GitHub Desktop. Right click on
                                            it and select “ignore file”. Notice how GitHub Desktop allows you to ignore
                                            all PDFs if we wanted to.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    Your GitHub Desktop should now look something like this:
                                    <figure>
                                        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="after-ignore.png" alt="" />
                                    </figure>
                                    Now, you can see that GitHub Desktop modified out <code>.gitignore</code> for us.
                                    A <code>.gitignore</code> is a plain text file that tells <code>git</code> which
                                    files not to ever track. By adding <code>101-Topics.pdf</code>, <code>git</code>
                                    will ignore any file with that exact name. If you remember when we first created
                                    this repository, we asked GitHub Desktop to use a Python <code>.gitignore</code>
                                    for us, which is why there are other lines in this file.
                                    <code>.gitignore</code> is a file that is tracked by <code>git</code>, so lets go
                                    ahead and commit with some message similar to “added 101 topics to the
                                    gitignore”, then push.
                                    Now, go to GitHub and look at what files GitHub has. Note that this does not
                                    include the <code>101-Topics.pdf</code>. If someone where to come and download
                                    your repository, <code>101-Topics.pdf</code> would not be downloaded with it -
                                    it only exists on your own computer.

                                    There is not 100% guide for when to add something to your
                                    <code>.gitignore</code>, but here are some rules of thumbs that I find useful.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If it is a file that can be generated completely from other files, aka
                                            output files</li>
                                        <li>If it is a large binary file that is frequently changing</li>
                                        <li>Temporary / other generated files</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    In general, if you select the <code>.gitignore</code> when creating your
                                    repository for the language you are using (if you forget you can download them
                                    here: <a
                                        href="https://github.com/github/gitignore">https://github.com/github/gitignore</a>),
                                    you should typically be okay. Nothing you do in CSCI 101 or 102 is heavy enough
                                    that you have to worry about the sizes of your <code>git</code> repositories.

                                    <h4>Submission for part 2</h4>

                                    Please submit to canvas a screenshot of the history page.
                                    If you used the <code>git</code> from the command line, you can run
                                    <code>git log &gt; gitlog.txt</code> and submit the resulting text file.
